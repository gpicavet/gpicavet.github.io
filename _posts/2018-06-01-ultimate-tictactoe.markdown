A react native implementation of the game described here : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe>.

The UI code has been bootstraped from excellent library <https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web>, which lets you create a native Android/IOS and a Web version of the same App in an effortless way !

The IA is a javascript version of my original C code developed for the Coding Game Challenge.
It is based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm and is doing pretty well :)
